# Percent Vaccination coverage for Polio in the world

### What is Polio?
Polio is an infectious disease, contracted predominantly by children, that can lead to the permanent paralysis of various body parts and can ultimately cause death by immobilizing the patient's breathing muscles. No cure exists for the symptoms, but in the 1950s effective vaccines were developed and have been used around the world since then. This allowed some richer countries to eliminate the disease entirely in the 1960s and 70s.

### What is this project about?
I wanted to know how polio vaccine coverage has changed from 1980 to 2017. This project is an exploratory analytical project to accurately visualize the increase in vaccination coverage across the globe. 
I was able to get the data from the WHO website using their API. I proceeded to clean this dataset in Pandas and continued to get other data from different sources to help visualize the data better.
I created the visualizations in Tableau. Heres the link to the complete story board:

A few interesting visualizations are as follows:
1. Avg % Polio vaccination coverage in the world between 1980 and 2017

### What have I learnt?

Polio vaccines were created in the 1960s and were prohibitively expensive. By the 1980s many countries had begun Polio eradication intiatives within thir own countires and saw a rapid improvement in access to the vaccine. After the GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative) was founded in 1988 the WHO lead charge of the program and implemented the program on a global scale. 
1. Between 1980 and 2017 the % coverage of vaccination increased from 26.37% to 87.71%. 
2. While all continents have made significant advances in avg % Polio vaccination coverage, Africa continues to be the continent with the lowest % vaccination coverage (79.67%) while Europe's % percent vaccination coverage is 93.5%. 
3. Africa is also the only state with lower than 80% avergae vaccination coverage
4. As of 2017 there are 7 countries in africa with less than 50% Average vaccination coverage with equatorial Guinea being the lower at 27%
5. There are 19 countries in Africa with 90% or over % vaccination coverage
6. Among Asian countries, Pakistan, Yemen and Afghanistan have the lowest % vaccination coverage.
7. There is an interesting general upward trend in % vaccination coverage in three neighboring countries; india, Pakistan and Afghanistan. As of 2017 India's % polio vaccination coverage is 88% while that of Pakistan is 75% and Afgahistan is at 60%
