# Percent Vaccination coverage for Polio in the world

### What is Polio?
Polio is an infectious disease, contracted predominantly by children, that can lead to the permanent paralysis of various body parts and can ultimately cause death by immobilizing the patient's breathing muscles. No cure exists for the symptoms, but in the 1950s effective vaccines were developed and have been used around the world since then. This allowed some richer countries to eliminate the disease entirely in the 1960s and 70s. But large outbreaks continued around the world and in the 1980s the estimated global number of paralytic cases was over 350,000 per year and the disease was still prevalent in 125 countries. As a response the "Global Polio Eradication Initiative" (GPEI) was founded in 1988 to fight the virus's spread and disease burden with a global vaccination campaign. Since then the world has made rapid progress against the disease and until 2016 the number of paralytic cases was reduced by 99.99% with 42 cases in that year worldwide. 

### What is this project about?
I wanted to know how polio vaccine coverage has changed from 1980 to 2017. This project is an exploratory analytical project to accurately visualize the increase in vaccination coverage across the globe. 
I was able to get the data from the WHO website using their API. I proceeded to clean this dataset in Pandas and continued to get other data from different sources to help visualize the data better.
I created the visualizations in Tableau. Heres the link to the complete story board:

A few interesting visualizations are as follows:
1. Avg % Polio vaccination coverage in the world between 1980 and 2017
